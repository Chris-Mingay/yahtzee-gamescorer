# Yahtzee GameScorer

A simple project providing an interface to parse and calculate a score from a yahtzee gameboard. This has been extended into a clean architecture based project, including both a Blazor server front end and a WebAPI.

This is by no means a finished project but is used to demonstrate my methodology when converting business requirements into an extendable architecture. While business requirements are ultimately the key to a valuable project I am passionate about writing code that's clear and robust enough to give new developers the confidence to work on it. 

## Features

- .NET 6
- Entity Framework (via multiple providers)
- Clean Architecture based
- Validated CQRS via Mediatr
- Web API
- Blazor Server (with some very minor TailwindCSS)
- Integration and Unit tests
- Separation of concern via Event Handling
- Interface based system definitions

## TODO

- Event handling example
- Multiple EF providers example
- System configuration example (interface for sending text messages)
